Discord Dice Bot



This is a bot for the application "Discord" that will imitate the rolling of a dice. The application can be added to any discord server
via the following link.


https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=543278810783809556&scope=bot&permissions=112640

Once there, simply click the drop down menu and add the bot "Dice Bot" to your server.

This will add the bot to your server.

To run the dice command, type in !rollDice in the discord chat, and the dice will be rolled.

Cloning this REPO will not work as the client ID will be unique to your own discord user. Please use the link.
