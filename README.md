Discord BOT



This is a bot for the application "Discord" that preforms various funcitonality for utility purposes.

for example typing the command !define followed by a space and then the word will define the word for you as shown below.

other functionality includes typing !rollDice will roll a dice. Typing !roll2Dice will roll two of them. 

overtime I will be adding random functionality. To get the current bot in its current phase, the link is below.


https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=543278810783809556&scope=bot&permissions=112640

Once there, simply click the drop down menu and add the bot "Dice Bot" to your server.

This will add the bot to your server.

To run the dice command, type in !rollDice in the discord chat, and the dice will be rolled.

Cloning this REPO will not work as the client ID will be unique to your own discord user. Please use the link.

UPDATE: 3/1/2019

Users were complaining about the ability to roll multiple dice at once, and this has now been implemented. To avoid server lagg, it's limited to two consecutive dice rolls.
